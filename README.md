# STRAP (Stow Rate Analyzer Program)

Calculates given rates and displays them in a formatted excel spreadsheet for users.

How to use:
  1. For first run, run main.py. A message "No files found in Original Files..." means that the folders were created and it works.
  2. Store the csv file to analyze. It should automatically run analysis and open a Excel document with proper formatting.
  
  Extra:
  a) If there are more than one file in the "Original Files", it will ask which file to run analysis. This program DOES NOT delete the files contained in the Original Files folder. YOU must DELETE.
